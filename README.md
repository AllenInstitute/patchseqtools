# patchseqtools
  
R functions for gene selection and analysis of patch-seq data.  
  
patchseqtools includes many functions that are used for QC and cell typing of patch-seq cells.  

Specific topics include:  
    1) Assigning quality scores to each cell (mostly wrapper functions for https://github.com/PavlidisLab/patchSeqQC)  
    2) Cell type mapping using tree mapping strategy (to be added later)  
    3) Cell type clustering using CCA (mostly wrapper functions for https://satijalab.org/seurat/Seurat_AlignmentTutorial.html)
